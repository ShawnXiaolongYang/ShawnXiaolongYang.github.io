here is the demo for the recommendation part.
The recommendation is based on two functional part: 
Represent what user recently view & guess user’s interest.
For our project, we need to apply those in both papers and researchers
In order to make user figure out what they actual read, an auto-play proto style or table style slides are better than a long list of articles. In this case, I would use the Carousel-slides skills to represent the information.
The framework is easy to understand, given user recently view researchers and papers, and then recommend the researchers and papers, based on either researcher they view or paper they view.
User can also click on the photo or table and then jump to the main page of the researcher or paper.
